## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Fixed

## [1.0.7] — 2026-05-30

### Added

- **Query cache extended to all graph commands**
  The query cache introduced in v1.0.6 for `callers` now covers every graph
  command that does a BFS/traversal query:
  - `impact` — `GraphContext` keyed on file_path + max_depth + HEAD
  - `function-impact` — `FlowContext` keyed on function + max_depth + HEAD
  - `deps` — `GraphContext` keyed on file_path + HEAD
  - `library` — `GraphContext` keyed on library_name + HEAD
  - `stats` — `WorkspaceContext` keyed on HEAD only (workspace-level result)
  - `critical` — `GraphContext` keyed on sort_metric + limit + HEAD
  - `routes` — `Vec<RouteEntry>` keyed on method_filter + file_filter + HEAD

  All commands skip graph loading entirely on a cache hit (~100ms vs ~2.7s).
  `--verbose` bypasses the cache on all commands. `unfault graph refresh`
  clears all cached results.

  `query_cache` module generalised: `get<T>` and `set<T>` accept any
  `Serialize + DeserializeOwned` type; typed convenience wrappers for each
  command keep call sites concise.

  `RouteEntry` now derives `Deserialize` (was `Serialize` only).

## [1.0.6] — 2026-05-30

### Added

- **`unfault graph callers` query cache — near-instant repeat queries**
  - BFS results (`CallersContext`) are cached to `.unfault/cache/query/` keyed
    on `xxh3(function_name + file_hint) + "_" + git-HEAD-sha`
  - On a cache hit the graph is never loaded — the result is served directly
    from a tiny msgpack file (~100ms total vs ~2.7s)
  - Cache is automatically invalidated whenever `git HEAD` changes (commit,
    reset, branch switch) — no manual intervention needed
  - `--debug` and `--verbose` bypass the cache and always run the full pipeline
  - Suggestions (`suggest_callers_candidates`) are skipped on cache hits since
    the graph is not loaded; this is fine because suggestions only appear when
    `callers` is empty, and cached results are only stored when callers were found

- **`unfault graph refresh`** — explicit cache reset + rebuild
  - Deletes the query cache (`.unfault/cache/query/`)
  - Deletes the graph cache (`graph.msgpack`)
  - Rebuilds the full graph immediately with a spinner
  - Reports the new HEAD commit SHA on completion
  - Use after major refactors, branch switches, or any time you want a
    guaranteed-fresh baseline before running `callers` or `routes`

## [1.0.5] — 2026-05-30

### Changed

- **`unfault fault` is now interactive** — replacing the flat wall of commands with a two-step selection flow powered by `dialoguer`:

  **Step 1 — target:** choose Ingress (the detected HTTP route) or any auto-detected Egress target (outbound HTTP call or DB query discovered by walking the call graph forward).

  **Step 2 — scenario:** pick from the 12 templates; each item shows the template name alongside a "why would I use this?" rationale so you can make an informed choice without already knowing the template names.

  **Output:** a single `fault run` command + the expected learning ("what will I confirm?") + the `curl` or `export` hint to wire the proxy, then exit.

  - `--template <name>` still works non-interactively for scripting/CI
  - Escape or `q` exits cleanly at either prompt
  - `FaultTemplate::why()` and `FaultTemplate::expected_learning()` methods added with full descriptions for all 12 scenarios

## [1.0.4] — 2026-05-30

### Added

- **`unfault fault` — automatic egress fault scenario generation**
  - After the existing ingress section, the command now walks **forward** through
    `Calls` edges from the target function, inspects `http_calls` and `orm_queries`
    on every reachable function, and emits a separate egress `fault run` block for
    each discovered outbound dependency
  - For HTTP calls with a statically-determinable string literal URL (e.g.
    `requests.get("https://payments.internal/charge", ...)`), the origin
    (`https://payments.internal`) is extracted and used as `--upstream`
  - For HTTP calls with a dynamic URL (env var, variable), a placeholder is
    shown so the user knows a call exists even without a concrete URL
  - For ORM queries (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, Tortoise, Peewee, etc.), a
    `fault run` targeting the default database port is generated
    (`postgresql://localhost:5432` for Postgres-family ORMs, `mysql://localhost:3306`
    for Peewee)
  - Egress proxies are assigned ports starting at `--port + 1` so all ingress
    and egress `fault run` commands can be run simultaneously without conflicts
  - The `--mode egress` flag still works for manual override (e.g. when the URL
    is not statically determinable)

- **Spinner on `unfault fault` while the graph is loading**
  - Same braille spinner as `unfault graph` commands; cleared before output,
    suppressed in `--verbose`

- **`HttpClientKind::as_str()`** added to `unfault-core` for use in labels

## [1.0.3] — 2026-05-30

### Added

- **Spinner on all `unfault graph` commands while the graph is loading**
  A braille spinner (`⠋⠙⠹…`) with "Building graph…" is shown on stderr
  while `build_analysis_graph` runs (~2.7s on large workspaces). The spinner
  is cleared before any output is printed, so it never interleaves with
  results. Suppressed automatically in `--verbose` (TIMING lines already give
  feedback) and `--json` (stdout must stay clean for piping).

## [1.0.2] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- `cargo fmt` cleanup of indentation inside `io_pool.install` closure (missed in v1.0.1)

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-30

### Performance

- **Dedicated I/O thread pool for cache reads (up to 64 threads)**
  The `par_iter` over 27k files uses Rayon's global pool which defaults to
  `num_cpus` threads — optimal for CPU-bound work but leaves threads idle
  while waiting on filesystem I/O. The cache read phase (stat + msgpack read
  per file) is now run in a dedicated `rayon::ThreadPool` with up to 64
  threads, allowing more concurrent I/O operations and better utilisation of
  SSD queue depth.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-30

### Changed (breaking internal architecture — no CLI API changes)

- **Unified type system: analysis crate is now a thin façade over unfault-core**

  The analysis crate previously maintained ~5000 lines of near-duplicate type
  definitions that diverged from core over time, causing JSON round-trip failures,
  missing bug fixes, and silent data loss. All shared types are now re-exported
  from core. Specific changes:

  **`analysis/src/semantics/python/model.rs`** (2771 lines → 24 lines)
  - `PyFileSemantics`, `PyFunction`, `PyImport`, `PyCallSite`, `PyParam`,
    `PyClass`, `PyAssignment`, `ImportInsertionType`, `ImportCategory`,
    `ImportStyle`, `BareExceptClause`, `AsyncOperation`, `AsyncOperationType`,
    `Decorator` are now `pub use unfault_core::semantics::python::model::*`
  - Analysis `PyFileSemantics` gains the three previously missing fields:
    `django`, `async_operations`, `decorators`
  - `PyFunction` gains `start_byte` and `end_byte`
  - `analyze_frameworks` now runs all seven analyzers (was four)
  - Multi-line parenthesised import parsing fix (`from pkg import (\n    foo,\n)`)
    now applies automatically (was only fixed in core)

  **`analysis/src/semantics/python/http.rs`** (901 lines → 5 lines)
  - `HttpCallSite`, `HttpClientKind`, `RetrySource`, `summarize_http_clients`
    re-exported from core; non-HTTP method filter fix ported to core first

  **`analysis/src/semantics/python/orm.rs`** (763 lines → 7 lines)
  - All ORM types re-exported from core

  **`analysis/src/semantics/common/calls.rs`** (33 lines → 2 lines)
  **`analysis/src/semantics/common/imports.rs`** (771 lines → 6 lines)
  **`analysis/src/semantics/common/http.rs`** (393 lines → 5 lines)
  **`analysis/src/semantics/common/db.rs`** (453 lines → 5 lines)
  - All re-exported from core; `CommonLocation` also re-exported from core

  **`analysis/src/graph/mod.rs`**
  - `GraphNode`, `GraphEdgeKind`, `ModuleCategory`, `SloProvider` are now
    `pub use unfault_core::graph::*` — ~230 lines of duplicate definitions removed
  - `CodeGraph` gains `suffix_to_file` and `module_to_file` index maps (matching
    core), making `find_file_by_path` O(1) instead of O(n linear scan)
  - `rebuild_indexes` now populates all 7 maps (was 5)
  - New `From<unfault_core::graph::CodeGraph> for CodeGraph` impl: direct field
    move + `rebuild_indexes`, zero copies, no serialization

  **`cli/src/local_graph.rs`**
  - JSON round-trip (`serde_json::to_string` + `serde_json::from_str`) replaced
    with `unfault_analysis::graph::CodeGraph::from(build_result.ir.graph)` — the
    ~300ms serialization cost is eliminated entirely on warm-cache runs

### Fixed

- `analysis/src/semantics/python/http.rs`: `httpx.URL()`, `httpx.Headers()` etc.
  were incorrectly detected as HTTP calls; non-HTTP method names are now filtered
  (fix already existed in analysis, now ported to core so both benefit)

## [0.9.16] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **Revert msgpack IR round-trip (v0.9.15) — deserialization failure**
  The analysis crate's `SourceSemantics::Python` carries extra fields
  (e.g. `flask: Option<FlaskFileSummary>`) absent from the core crate's
  version. JSON tolerates missing fields via serde's `#[serde(default)]`;
  msgpack does not by default, causing `rmp_serde::from_slice` to fail
  on every graph command. Reverted to `serde_json` for the round-trip.
  The correct long-term fix (unifying the two IR types) is tracked separately.

## [0.9.15] — 2026-05-29

### Performance

- **Replace JSON round-trip with msgpack in `build_analysis_graph`**
  `local_graph.rs` converted between the core and analysis `IntermediateRepresentation`
  types via `serde_json::to_string` + `serde_json::from_str`. On a 27k-function
  graph this produced a large JSON string (text formatting, UTF-8 escaping,
  allocation per token) before immediately discarding it. Replaced with
  `rmp_serde::to_vec` + `rmp_serde::from_slice` — same Serde round-trip,
  binary format, ~10x faster serialization, far fewer allocations.

## [0.9.14] — 2026-05-29

### Changed

- **`SemanticsCache` internal redesign — lock-free read path**
  - `CacheStats` now uses `AtomicUsize` for `hits` and `misses` — all read
    methods can increment counters without holding any lock
  - All read methods (`check_metadata`, `get`, `record_metadata_hit`,
    `record_miss`, `get_stored_content_hash`) take `&self` instead of
    `&mut self` — they are safe to call from multiple threads with only
    a shared reference
  - Only `set()` (called on cache misses, the slow path) retains `&mut self`
  - `CacheStats` replaced by `CacheStatsSnapshot` (plain `usize` fields) for
    display and the `IrBuildResult` public API; `stats_snapshot()` takes a
    lock-free snapshot
  - The `Mutex<SemanticsCache>` in `ir_builder.rs` is now held for
    nanoseconds (index lookup only) on the hot path; the msgpack file read
    already happened outside the lock since v0.9.13
  - Practical effect: the remaining ~1s "File read + cache" time on a 27k-file
    warm cache is dominated by filesystem I/O (reading 27k msgpack files),
    not lock contention — a more specialised mutex would not have helped

## [0.9.13] — 2026-05-29

### Performance

- **Fix mtime fast path mutex contention (warm cache still slow at ~1.2s)**
  The v0.9.12 mtime fast path read the msgpack cache file *inside* the
  `Mutex<SemanticsCache>` lock. With 27k files all hitting the fast path in
  parallel via `par_iter`, the mutex serialised all file I/O — no better than
  before.
  Fix: split into two phases. Phase 1 (under lock, ~100ns): look up the index
  entry, return the cache file path if mtime+size match. Phase 2 (outside
  lock): read the msgpack file in parallel across Rayon threads. The lock is
  held only for the in-memory HashMap lookup; all I/O is concurrent.
  Expected warm-cache "File read + cache" to drop from ~1.2s to ~150–300ms.

## [0.9.12] — 2026-05-29

### Performance

- **Warm-cache runs 3–5× faster on large workspaces**

  Two independent optimisations targeting the two most expensive phases
  measured on a 27k-file codebase (was ~4s total on a warm cache):

  **1. mtime + size fast path for per-file cache lookup (saves ~1.5s)**
  Previously every file was read from disk on every run just to compute
  its content hash before checking the cache. The cache now stores
  `mtime_secs` and `file_size` alongside `content_hash`. On the next run
  only the file metadata is read (syscall, no I/O); if mtime and size
  match the stored values the file read is skipped entirely and the cached
  semantics are returned directly. Legacy cache entries (version < 4)
  without metadata fall back to the old content-hash path gracefully.
  `CACHE_VERSION` bumped to 4 — existing cache entries will be rebuilt
  on the first run and the fast path will apply from the second run onward.

  **2. Graph cache on disk (saves ~1.3s)**
  The petgraph was rebuilt from all semantics entries on every run even
  when nothing had changed. A `graph.msgpack` file is now stored in
  `.unfault/cache/`. It is keyed on an aggregate xxh3 hash of all file
  content hashes (stable across runs when no file changes). On a fully
  warm cache the graph is loaded directly instead of being rebuilt,
  eliminating the `build_code_graph` call entirely. The cache is
  invalidated automatically whenever any file changes.

  **Expected warm-cache timing after first primed run:**
  - File discovery: ~600ms (unchanged — filesystem walk)
  - File read + cache: ~200ms (was ~1600ms)
  - Graph build: ~50ms (was ~1300ms, now just loading msgpack)
  - Total: ~1s (was ~4s)

## [0.9.11] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **Multi-line parenthesised imports had parentheses included in name strings**
  - `from pkg import (\n    foo,\n    bar,\n)` was storing `"(\n    foo"` as the first name instead of `"foo"`
  - This caused `imports_item("foo")` to return `false`, so cross-file `Calls` edges were never added for any function imported this way
  - Fix: strip leading `(` / trailing `)` from `names_part` before splitting on `,`, and additionally trim `()`  from each individual name
  - 2 new tests: `multiline_import_names_parsed_correctly`, `function_scoped_multiline_import_names_parsed_correctly`

## [0.9.10] — 2026-05-29

### Changed

- **`unfault graph callers --debug`** — extended diagnostics
  - Also searches for `_<function_name>` (underscore-prefixed handler) and prints its outgoing `Calls` edges with callee names and files
  - This reveals whether the edge from the handler to the target exists at all, or whether the cross-file resolution failed to add it

## [0.9.9] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **`unfault graph callers --debug`** — raw graph diagnostics for the target function
  - Prints every graph node whose name matches the query, with its file path, handler metadata, and count of incoming/outgoing `Calls` edges
  - Lists each caller by name and file when incoming edges exist
  - Designed to diagnose "found in graph but no call edges resolved" cases by showing exactly what the graph contains before the BFS runs

### Tests

- 3 more graph edge tests: `flask_handler_with_underscore_prefix_calls_inner_function`, `action_route_handler_cross_file_call_function_scoped_import`, `action_route_with_inner_decorators_cross_file_call`

## [0.9.8] — 2026-05-29

### Tests

- **Cross-file call resolution from Flask handlers — 3 new tests confirming behaviour**
  - `flask_handler_cross_file_call_via_module_level_import` — `from services.users import get_all_users` at top of file, called inside `@app.route` handler
  - `flask_handler_cross_file_call_via_function_scoped_import` — same import made *inside* the handler body (`def list_users(): from services.users import get_all_users; return get_all_users()`)
  - `flask_restful_action_route_cross_file_call_via_function_scoped_import` — same function-scoped import pattern inside an `@ClassName.action_route` handler
  - All three pass: function-scoped imports are captured by the semantic extractor (with `is_module_level: false`) and the import lookup in `resolve_cross_file_call` does not filter by scope, so they resolve identically to module-level imports

## [0.9.7] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **Version bump only** — `unfault-core` was not bumped in v0.9.6 despite changes to `core/src/graph/mod.rs` (`add_flask_nodes`, `handler_names_to_skip` update). Bumps: core 0.4.6, analysis 0.3.7, cli 0.9.7.

## [0.9.6] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **`unfault graph callers` — two bugs causing "no call edges were resolved"**

  **Bug 1 — Double node for framework route handlers:**
  The analysis graph builder called `add_function_nodes` (which emits a plain
  `Function { is_handler: false, http_method: None, http_path: None }` node)
  and then `add_flask_nodes` / `add_fastapi_nodes` (which emit a second
  `Function { is_handler: true, http_method: Some(...), http_path: Some(...) }`
  node for the same handler). `function_nodes` was overwritten with the
  framework node (inserted last). The `Calls` edges from the third pass
  referenced the first node. `get_callers` looked up the framework node but
  found no incoming edges — zero callers.
  **Fix:** Add `handler_names_to_skip` to the analysis graph's
  `add_function_nodes`, mirroring the core graph builder's existing logic.

  **Bug 2 — Wrong caller key in the Calls edge pass:**
  The third pass iterated `sem.function_calls()` and looked up the caller in
  `function_nodes` using `func_call.caller_qualified_name` (e.g.
  `"MyClass.method"`). But `function_nodes` is keyed by the simple function
  name (e.g. `"method"`). The lookup always failed, so **zero `Calls` edges
  were ever added** in the analysis graph for method callers.
  **Fix:** Use `func_call.caller_function` (simple name) as the lookup key,
  falling back to the last segment of `caller_qualified_name`.

  **Cross-file call resolution added to analysis graph:**
  The analysis graph's Calls pass was intra-file only. It now also resolves
  calls through imports using `resolve_cross_file_call`, implementing the
  same three strategies as the core graph: direct import, module-attribute,
  and submodule-as-item.

  **3 new tests:** `intra_file_calls_edge_added`, `flask_handler_not_duplicated_in_graph`, `intra_file_calls_edge_from_flask_handler`

## [0.9.5] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **`unfault graph routes`** — new command listing every HTTP route detected across the workspace
  - Output grouped by source file; each line shows `METHOD  /path  (handler_name)`
  - `--method GET` filters to a specific HTTP verb (case-insensitive)
  - `--file src/api` filters to files whose path contains the substring
  - `--json` emits a JSON array of `{ method, path, handler, file }` objects
  - Works across all supported frameworks: Flask (all patterns), FastAPI, Express, Gin, Axum, Actix, Rocket

- **Flask routes wired into the code graph** (was silently dropped before this release)
  - `build_code_graph()` in both `core` and `analysis` graph builders now has a `py.flask` branch alongside the existing `py.fastapi` branch
  - A new `add_flask_nodes()` function emits `GraphNode::Function { is_handler: true, http_method: Some(...), http_path: Some(...) }` for every `FlaskRoute` in `FlaskFileSummary` — covering all patterns: `@app.route`, `@bp.route`, `@blp.route` on MethodView classes, and `@ClassName.action_route`
  - Flask handler names are added to `handler_names_to_skip` in `add_function_nodes()` so they are not double-emitted as plain nameless handlers
  - `unfault graph callers`, `unfault graph stats`, and all other graph commands now see Flask routes

## [0.9.4] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Flask `action_route` / custom BaseController pattern support**
  - Detects routes defined through a two-level convention used in Flask-RESTful-based codebases:
    1. A controller class is registered to a base path via `@endpoint.route("/base")` on the class definition
    2. Individual handlers are attached via `@ClassName.action_route("/sub", methods=["GET"])` as the outermost decorator on the handler function
  - Full path is formed by joining the class base path with the handler sub-path: `"/base"` + `"/sub"` → `"/base/sub"`
  - Inner decorators (e.g. `@inject_auth`, `@log_request`) between `action_route` and the function are ignored — only the outermost decorator is inspected
  - `methods` kwarg is parsed identically to `@app.route(methods=[...])`: single entry → that verb, multiple → `"ANY"`, absent → `"GET"`
  - If no matching class registration is found for a given controller name, the sub-path from `action_route` is used directly as the route path
  - `is_async`, `has_try_except`, handler name, and byte ranges are all populated correctly
  - The two passes (`collect_action_route_class_bases` and `collect_action_route_handlers`) are fully recursive so the pattern is detected inside factory functions too
  - Workspace scanner now also triggers Flask profile detection for `from flask_restful import`, `import flask_restful`, and `.action_route(` text patterns
  - Profile `flask_routes` file hint extended with `.action_route(` and `BaseController`; `flask_blueprints` hint extended with `from flask_restful import` and `Endpoint(`
  - 10 new tests covering: simple GET, multiple methods, sub-path joining, inner decorators ignored, default GET, multiple controllers, orphaned handler (no class base), try/except detection, async handler, mixed with regular `@app.route`

## [0.9.3] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **FastAPI application factory pattern support**
  - Routes, apps, middlewares, routers, and exception handlers defined inside factory functions (e.g. `def create_app()`) are now confirmed working — all collectors in `summarize_fastapi` were already fully recursive; this release documents and tests that behaviour explicitly with 6 new tests
  - 6 new core tests covering: factory app, factory routes, `include_router` with prefix inside a factory, `add_middleware` inside a factory, `@app.exception_handler` inside a factory, and router-only factory functions

### Changed

- **Eliminated `fastapi.rs` duplication between core and analysis crates**
  - `analysis/src/semantics/python/fastapi.rs` (1816 lines) replaced with a 12-line re-export facade: `pub use unfault_core::semantics::python::fastapi::*`
  - `analysis/src/semantics/python/model.rs` now calls `unfault_core::semantics::python::fastapi::summarize_fastapi` directly (same pattern already used for Flask)
  - All FastAPI rule tests and graph code continue to work unchanged via the re-export; the 49 previously duplicated tests in the analysis crate are now the canonical tests in the core crate

## [0.9.2] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Flask application factory pattern support**
  - Routes (`@app.route`, `@blp.route` on MethodView) defined inside factory functions (e.g. `def create_app()`) are now detected — the AST collectors were already fully recursive, confirming routes were found; this release documents and tests that behaviour explicitly
  - New `FlaskConfigSetting` type in `FlaskFileSummary` captures config values set via the two factory-pattern idioms:
    - Subscript assignment: `app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = "value"`
    - `update()` call: `app.config.update(SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=False, ...)`
  - All three Flask rules (`hardcoded_secret_key`, `missing_session_timeout`, `insecure_cookie_settings`) now check both module-level assignments and `flask.config_settings`, so hardcoded keys and insecure cookie flags set inside `create_app()` are caught
  - `flask` field added to the analysis crate's `PyFileSemantics` (populated via `unfault_core::semantics::python::flask::summarize_flask`), making the full Flask semantic summary available to all rules without re-implementing extraction
  - 7 new tests covering: factory routes, subscript config assignment, `update()` kwargs, mixed patterns, non-config attribute filtering, blueprint registration, and MethodView inside a factory

## [0.9.1] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Flask-smorest / MethodView route detection**
  - `@blp.route('/path')` decorating a `MethodView` subclass is now parsed: each HTTP-method-named method (`get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`, `options`, `head`) produces its own `FlaskRoute` entry with the path from the class-level decorator
  - `handler_name` is set to `ClassName.method` (e.g. `ItemList.get`) for unique identification
  - Methods decorated with `@blp.arguments` / `@blp.response` are correctly unwrapped and detected
  - Non-HTTP methods (`__init__`, helpers, etc.) are ignored
  - `flask_smorest` imports (`from flask_smorest import …` / `import flask_smorest`) now trigger Flask framework detection in the workspace scanner
  - `flask_smorest.Blueprint` (`blp = Blueprint('name', __name__, description=…)`) is detected as a Flask blueprint — no change needed at the AST level since the call site is identical to `flask.Blueprint`
  - File hints in the `python_flask_backend` profile extended: `@blp.route(`, `MethodView`, `from flask_smorest import Blueprint` added to `flask_routes`, `flask_blueprints`, and `flask_app` hint patterns

### Fixed

- **`unfault fault` — correct `fault run` flag usage** per the fault-project.com CLI reference:
  - `--disable-http-proxy --proxy PORT=URL` → `--proxy-address 127.0.0.1:PORT` + `--upstream URL`
  - `--schedule-start`/`--schedule-end` (non-existent) → `--<fault>-sched "start:25%,duration:50%"` using relative intervals that scale with `--duration`
  - `latency-pareto` template: `--latency-mean`/`--latency-stddev` → `--latency-shape 1.5 --latency-scale 20` (correct params for pareto distribution)
  - Bandwidth templates: added `--bandwidth-unit KBps` (default unit is `Bps`)
  - Packet loss templates: `--packet-loss-rate`/`--packet-loss-mode` (non-existent) → `--packet-loss-direction`
  - Blackhole templates: added `--blackhole-direction` (was missing)

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- **`unfault graph callers <file:function>`** — "you are here" inbound call chain view
  - New CLI command that traces who calls a given function and which HTTP routes anchor the chain
  - Renders a proper multi-branch tree with `├─` / `└─` connectors: all direct callers shown, not just one representative path
  - `--max-depth` controls how many hops to follow (default 5), `--json` emits structured output
  - When a function is found but has no call edges, suggests HTTP route handlers in the same file or same module directory as ready-to-use next steps
  - When a function name is not in the graph, shows fuzzy name-matched suggestions ranked by token overlap

- **`unfault fault <file:function>`** — fault injection scenario generator
  - New top-level command generating ready-to-run `fault run` commands (https://fault-project.com) for endpoints reachable from a given function
  - Resolves HTTP routes via the code graph; supports `--template` to select one of 12 named scenarios or prints all 12 by default
  - All 12 templates from the VSCode extension: `latency-normal`, `latency-pareto`, `latency-window`, `jitter-light`, `jitter-bidirectional`, `bandwidth-64k`, `bandwidth-48k-latency`, `mobile-3g`, `packet-loss`, `packet-loss-burst`, `blackhole`, `blackhole-window`
  - `--mode ingress` (default): proxies between curl and the local app, prints a companion `curl` command; `--mode egress`: proxies between the app and a remote dependency
  - `file:function` scoping: `service.py:get` resolves only the `get` function in that file, not every `get` across the workspace

- **FastAPI router prefix resolution**
  - `include_router(router, prefix="/assistant")` is now parsed: `prefix` keyword argument is extracted from the AST and stored on `FastApiRouter`
  - Routes registered on a sub-router now carry the full prefixed path (e.g. `/assistant/scenario/{id}` instead of `/scenario/{id}`) throughout the graph, in both `FastApiRoute` nodes and `Function { http_path }` fields
  - Prefix is resolved in the core graph builder (`unfault-core`) which is the path used at runtime by all CLI commands

- **Cross-file call edge resolution: submodule-as-item pattern**
  - Added Strategy 3 to `resolve_call_through_imports`: handles `from pkg import submodule` followed by `submodule.func()` — previously unresolved because the import's `local_module_name()` is the parent package, not the submodule alias
  - Resolves the submodule path as `pkg.submodule` and looks up the callee there

- **`unfault graph callers` help text**: added description, examples, and flag explanations

### Fixed

- **`unfault fault` route scoping**: passing `file.py:get` previously stripped the file prefix and matched every function named `get` across the entire workspace. The file hint is now threaded into `find_nodes_by_name_in_file` which filters to nodes whose file path ends with the hint before falling back to workspace-wide matches
- **`fault run` flag formatting**: multi-word flags (`--latency-direction ingress`) were being split across separate continuation lines; each flag+value pair is now kept on a single line
- **Stale `format_list` dead code** removed from `cli/src/commands/review.rs`

### Tests

- Updated `router_expr_contains_full_arguments` → `router_expr_is_first_positional_arg_and_prefix_extracted` in both `core` and `analysis` crates to reflect that `router_expr` now stores only the first positional argument and `prefix` is a separate field

### Flask first-class framework support (from prior unreleased work)

- Added `python.flask.hardcoded_secret_key`, `python.flask.session_timeout`, and `python.flask.insecure_cookie_settings` rules to the `python_flask_backend` profile
- Added `Dimension::Security` and `Dimension::Performance` to the Flask profile
- Added resilience and observability rules to the Flask profile: `missing_circuit_breaker`, `graceful_shutdown`, `unbounded_retry`, `unbounded_memory`, `large_response_memory`, `missing_correlation_id`
- Added five new file hints to the Flask profile: `flask_routes`, `flask_blueprints`, `flask_config`, `python_middleware`, `python_resilience`
- Fixed `@app.route('/path', methods=['POST'])` always mapping to `"GET"` — `methods` kwarg is now parsed correctly
- Fixed Flask cookie settings rule returning wrong applicability preset
