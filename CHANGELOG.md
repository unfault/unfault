## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- **`unfault graph callers <file:function>`** — "you are here" inbound call chain view
  - New CLI command that traces who calls a given function and which HTTP routes anchor the chain
  - Renders a proper multi-branch tree with `├─` / `└─` connectors: all direct callers shown, not just one representative path
  - `--max-depth` controls how many hops to follow (default 5), `--json` emits structured output
  - When a function is found but has no call edges, suggests HTTP route handlers in the same file or same module directory as ready-to-use next steps
  - When a function name is not in the graph, shows fuzzy name-matched suggestions ranked by token overlap

- **`unfault fault <file:function>`** — fault injection scenario generator
  - New top-level command generating ready-to-run `fault run` commands (https://fault-project.com) for endpoints reachable from a given function
  - Resolves HTTP routes via the code graph; supports `--template` to select one of 12 named scenarios or prints all 12 by default
  - All 12 templates from the VSCode extension: `latency-normal`, `latency-pareto`, `latency-window`, `jitter-light`, `jitter-bidirectional`, `bandwidth-64k`, `bandwidth-48k-latency`, `mobile-3g`, `packet-loss`, `packet-loss-burst`, `blackhole`, `blackhole-window`
  - `--mode ingress` (default): proxies between curl and the local app, prints a companion `curl` command; `--mode egress`: proxies between the app and a remote dependency
  - `file:function` scoping: `service.py:get` resolves only the `get` function in that file, not every `get` across the workspace

- **FastAPI router prefix resolution**
  - `include_router(router, prefix="/assistant")` is now parsed: `prefix` keyword argument is extracted from the AST and stored on `FastApiRouter`
  - Routes registered on a sub-router now carry the full prefixed path (e.g. `/assistant/scenario/{id}` instead of `/scenario/{id}`) throughout the graph, in both `FastApiRoute` nodes and `Function { http_path }` fields
  - Prefix is resolved in the core graph builder (`unfault-core`) which is the path used at runtime by all CLI commands

- **Cross-file call edge resolution: submodule-as-item pattern**
  - Added Strategy 3 to `resolve_call_through_imports`: handles `from pkg import submodule` followed by `submodule.func()` — previously unresolved because the import's `local_module_name()` is the parent package, not the submodule alias
  - Resolves the submodule path as `pkg.submodule` and looks up the callee there

- **`unfault graph callers` help text**: added description, examples, and flag explanations

### Fixed

- **`unfault fault` route scoping**: passing `file.py:get` previously stripped the file prefix and matched every function named `get` across the entire workspace. The file hint is now threaded into `find_nodes_by_name_in_file` which filters to nodes whose file path ends with the hint before falling back to workspace-wide matches
- **`fault run` flag formatting**: multi-word flags (`--latency-direction ingress`) were being split across separate continuation lines; each flag+value pair is now kept on a single line
- **Stale `format_list` dead code** removed from `cli/src/commands/review.rs`

### Tests

- Updated `router_expr_contains_full_arguments` → `router_expr_is_first_positional_arg_and_prefix_extracted` in both `core` and `analysis` crates to reflect that `router_expr` now stores only the first positional argument and `prefix` is a separate field

### Flask first-class framework support (from prior unreleased work)

- Added `python.flask.hardcoded_secret_key`, `python.flask.session_timeout`, and `python.flask.insecure_cookie_settings` rules to the `python_flask_backend` profile
- Added `Dimension::Security` and `Dimension::Performance` to the Flask profile
- Added resilience and observability rules to the Flask profile: `missing_circuit_breaker`, `graceful_shutdown`, `unbounded_retry`, `unbounded_memory`, `large_response_memory`, `missing_correlation_id`
- Added five new file hints to the Flask profile: `flask_routes`, `flask_blueprints`, `flask_config`, `python_middleware`, `python_resilience`
- Fixed `@app.route('/path', methods=['POST'])` always mapping to `"GET"` — `methods` kwarg is now parsed correctly
- Fixed Flask cookie settings rule returning wrong applicability preset
